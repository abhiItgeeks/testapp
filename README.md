## Deployment


### Build

The frontend is a single page React app. It requires the `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` environment variable, which you can find on the page for your app in your partners dashboard.
The CLI will set up the necessary environment variables for the build if you run its `build` command from your app's root:

Using yarn:

```shell
yarn build --api-key=REPLACE_ME
```

Using npm:

```shell
npm run build --api-key=REPLACE_ME
```

Using pnpm:

```shell
pnpm run build --api-key=REPLACE_ME
```

The app build command will build both the frontend and backend when running as above.
If you're manually building (for instance when deploying the `web` folder to production), you'll need to build both of them:

```shell
cd web/frontend
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=REPLACE_ME yarn build
cd ..
composer build
```
